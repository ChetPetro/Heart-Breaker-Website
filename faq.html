    <!--FAQ Start-->
    <div class="faq_content">
        <h2 class="faq_question">How can I collect pledges?</h2>
        <p class="faq_answer">There are two ways to collect pledges. You can download a printable pledge form <a href="http://heartbreakerchallenge.org/Downloads/Pledgesheet2021.pdf" target="_blank" style="font-family:inherit; color: blue; font-size: inherit;">here</a> and collect pledges in person, or you can send people the link to your personal fundraising page and invite them to support you online. Any pledges you collect in person can be turned in when you pick up your event packet, or on the day of the event. Either way, any donations you collect stay 100% local supporting Hotel-Dieu Grace Healthcare's Cardiac Wellness Centre and Pulmonary Rehab Program.
          </p>
        <h2 class="faq_question">Can I get a refund if I can no longer make the event?</h2>
        <p class="faq_answer">The Heart Breaker Challenge is a fundraising event. We do not offer refunds. If you would like your registration fee to be converted to a donation and receive a tax receipt, please email <a href="mailto: linda.daloisio@hdgh.org" target="_blank" style="font-family:inherit; color: blue; font-size: inherit;">linda.daloisio@hdgh.org</a> for more info.</p>
        <h2 class="faq_question">Can I transfer my registration to another participant?</h2>
        <p class="faq_answer">Yes! Registration Transfers are possible. <br><br> Please contact <a href="mailto: heartbreakercontact@gmail.com" target="_blank" style="font-family:inherit; color: blue; font-size: inherit;">heartbreakercontact@gmail.com</a> for details on how to proceed</p>
        <h2 class="faq_question">When can I pick up my event packet?</h2>
        <p class="faq_answer">When: Friday, May 26, 2023 9am-8pm or Saturday, May 27, 2023 9am-12pm.
          <br/><br/>Where: Matchette Road entrance of Malden Park, Windsor, ON – look for the big tent set up inside Malden Park, you won’t be able to miss it!
          <br/><br/>You MUST come in person to pick up your Event Packet with a government issued photo ID.  You CAN NOT pick up anyone else’s Event Packet – including your Team Members as per the request of the Alcohol & Gaming Commission of Ontario.
          <br/><br/>You will be required to sign an Event Waiver (this is separate from Race Roster’s online registration waiver).  Waivers will be available for you to review/sign when you arrive. A wrist band WILL be placed on your wrist and must be worn when you arrive on September May 27, 2023 to participate in the event. 
          <br/><br/>If you are a Participant who is 16 or 17 years old, a Parent or Guardian MUST sign your waiver. You will need to print and review the attached <a href="http://heartbreakerchallenge.org/Downloads/Waiver-Heartbreaker2021.pdf" target="_blank" style="font-family:inherit; color: blue; font-size: inherit;">Event Waiver</a>, and have your Parent or Guardian sign it, and bring it with you when you come to pick up your Event Packet.
          </p>
        <h2 class="faq_question">Do I need to wear my wristband all throughout the event?</h2>
        <p class="faq_answer">A wrist band WILL be placed on your wrist to identify you as a Participant. It MUST remain on, and be worn on Event Day (May 27, 2023). You will NOT be provided with a replacement wrist band. Different coloured wrist bands will identify you as under 19yrs, or 19yrs and older. You WILL NOT be served alcohol without a proper coloured wrist band.
          <br/><br/>You will receive your BIB # that must be worn to gain access to the Start corral for your wave start time.  Please place your BIB # on the FRONT of your body on Event Day.  This allows our announcer the opportunity to identify you and your team as you approach the Finish area.
          </p>
        <h2 class="faq_question">Where can I bring my pledges?</h2>
        <p class="faq_answer">All pledges collected manually MUST be brought in when you pick up your Event Packet.</p>
        <h2 class="faq_question">What can I expect on Event Day?</h2>
        <p class="faq_answer">Remember, this event is at the Matchette Rd. entrance of Malden Park, Windsor, ON. (not the Malden Rd. entrance)
          <br/><br/>•	Event Packet Pick Up May 26, 2023 from 9am-8pm.

          </p>
        <h2 class="faq_question">Do you have a place where I can leave my belongings?</h2>
        <p class="faq_answer">Bag Drop Off – There will be an area to drop off your bag to be picked up after you complete the event.  You will need your BIB # or Wrist Band to identify yourself when retrieving your bag. Please do not bring large or heavy bags as we have a limited amount of space.  Bring only what you need!  Once you retrieve your bag, it becomes your responsibility. </p>
        <h2 class="faq_question">When do I need to be ready in the starting area?</h2>
        <p class="faq_answer">Start Corral - Be sure to be at the Start Corral 20 minutes before your wave start time.  (Your wave start time will be printed on the front of your BIB #.) You will be checking in with a Starter upon arrival to the Start Corral. You will remain in the Start Corral until your wave is released.</p>
        <h2 class="faq_question">What happens when I finish?</h2>
        <p class="faq_answer">Participants will receive a can of alcoholic beverage and/or water after they cross the Finish Line provided you have the proper coloured wristband. Additional alcohol, food and beverage tickets will be available for sale in the Main Tent. CASH sales only, there will be no ATM on site.</p>
        <h2 class="faq_question">Will you have showers?</h2>
        <p class="faq_answer">There will also be a cold water showering off station and change tents for Participants to use after completing the event. We encourage you to bring warm, dry clothes to change into afterwards to enjoy the post challenge fun.</p>
        <h2 class="faq_question">Do I need to stick with my team?</h2>
        <p class="faq_answer">Teams – if you are on a team of four, the entire team will start and finish as a team. This is not a relay, this is not a race. Heart Breaker Challenge is about teamwork, fun and fitness! </p>
        <h2 class="faq_question">Do I need to complete each obstacle?</h2>
        <p class="faq_answer">Some of the obstacles are designed specifically for people to complete together, and you will be asked to complete them as a team. Some of the obstacles will have varying degrees of difficulty. For those, you can choose whichever level of difficulty you wish. Regardless, every obstacle is OPTIONAL. If at any time you want to avoid an obstacle, you can do so at your discretion.</p>
        <h2 class="faq_question">What should I wear for the Heart Breaker?</h2>
        <p class="faq_answer">Consider the weather before you come, the event will happen rain or shine. We reserve the right to delay the event if lightning is visible. 
          <br/><br/>We recommend old running shoes, gloves, long sleeved shirts, old athletic pants and layers depending on the temperature.  Costumes are optional and encouraged. However, please do not wear any sort of accessory that could catch on anyone or an obstacle.
          <br/><br/>Bring a towel and most of all a change of clothes – you will get a little dirty!
          <br/><br/>Head cams etc. are permitted on the course! Pets are not allowed on the course.
          <br/><br/>Finally, remember to tie your shoes extra tight… the mud is sticky!
          </p>
        <h2 class="faq_question">Family and friends are coming to watch me, what can I tell them?</h2>
        <p class="faq_answer">Spectators are not allowed on or in ANY obstacle area.
          <br/><br/>Spectators are not allowed on or in ANY obstacle area. They will need to bring government issued photo ID and wear a wristband if they would like to purchase an alcoholic beverage.
          <br/><br/>Please be mindful of all the Participants when walking through the park to different viewing areas.
          <br/><br/>There is no cost to enter the Main Event Area, but we would be happy to accept donations.
