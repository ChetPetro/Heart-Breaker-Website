        <h2 class="about_heading">About Us<br><br></h2>
        <p class ="about_text">The Petro Family has been passionate about fundraising to support Cardiac, Stroke & Pulmonary Rehabilitation programs at our local hospitals.  Since the year 2000 the Petro Family have volunteered to act as the Lead Organizers for various physical activity-based fundraising events on an annual basis.  Their love of sport, fun, friendly competition and all things outdoors lead them down a path that brought them to the conceptualization and creation of the Heart Breaker Challenge. <br><br> All of the events organized by the Petro Family have positively impacted not only the thousands of event participants, but also the thousands of patients who attend Cardiac, Stroke & Pulmonary rehabilitation programs that have benefitted from the fundraising proceeds over the years.  Heart Breaker Challenge is a true health and community-focused event that allows participants, sponsors and volunteers the opportunity to “Get Fit, Get Dirty and Give Back”.</p>
        <p class="about_name"><b>Jason Petro</b></p>
        <p class="about_text">The Master Creator of all things Heart Breaker Challenge. After 18 months of planning, Jason fearlessly led this small group of committee members and the first Heart Breaker Challenge event occurred on May 4, 2013. Jason hasn't stopped looking for ways to improve the quality of the event, and maximize the fundraising impact of the event each year.  Many hours of Heart Breaker Challenge "talk" occur all year, every year, at every Petro family gathering. Jason is well known for moving at full speed all the time, so if you can catch him, introduce yourself! He’d love to hear what you think about the event, or the story of how you, a friend, or family member is connected to one of the important rehabilitation programs that his passion for fundraising has supported.</p>
        <p class="about_name"><b>David Petro - Course Lead</b></p>
        <p class="about_text">The Master Designer of the Heart Breaker Challenge course and obstacles each year. David eats, drinks and sleeps obstacle design and management through the year and always comes up with a new and unique obstacle or two each year. Just don't upset him or else he might make you solve a math equation on the course!</p>
        <p class="about_name"><b>Heidi Petro - Registration & Village Lead</b></p>
        <p class="about_text">Heidi is the better half of Jason. She is the go-to for all things with respect to registration and the organization of the Heart Breaker Challenge “village” area logistics on Friday and Saturday. She runs a tight ship and ensures that registration and packet pick up run smoothly and according to the requirements set out by the Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario. Heidi and Jason have spent countless hours together talking about Heart Breaker Challenge over the years so if you have any questions, you can ask either one. However, just to be clear, Heidi is the true “Boss” as we all know girls rule the world!</p>
        <p class="about_name"><b>George Petro - Obstacle Support</b></p>
        <p class="about_text">The "Mr. Make-it-Work" and "Mr. Fix-It" of Heart Breaker Challenge! George can tinker or MacGyver anything that the Heart Breaker Challenge obstacles need. If you are fortunate enough to receive one of the coveted Heart Breaker Challenge Award Trophies, let it be known that George was the creative genius behind each hand crafted and unique piece of art. </p>
        <p class="about_name"><b>Pat Petro - Parking </b></p>
        <p class="about_text">The Master Negotiator in the Petro family, Pat is gracious in coordinating the Heart Breaker Challenge event parking. With the bulk of participants all arriving in the first few hours, it takes a special kind of Petro to manage the massive influx of excited people!</p>
        <p class="about_name"><b>Bill Petro - Photography Lead</b></p>
        <p class="about_text">That moment when you cross the finish line or when you are posing with your Heart Breaker Challenge team mates, Bill is the one who captures those memorable points in time. Bill  coordinates, manages and organizes the Heart Breaker Challenge event photos and volunteer photographers. He’s probably the most popular “Petro” on event day!</p>
        <p class="about_name"><b>Shawn Fryer - Everything Support </b></p>
        <p class="about_text">Shawn is a Petro brother from another mother, and is most often mistaken as the youngest biological Petro, because he looks like one, and acts like one!  Shawn is a workhorse like no other and provides support from dawn until dusk to anyone that asks over the 4 days for every Heart Breaker Challenge that includes 2 days of set up, the actual event day, and 1 day of tear down.  He always says, "no problem", despite a repeated history of being requested to complete some of the most difficult tasks available. The Petro family owes Shawn (and his wife and children) big time for all of his support! </p>
